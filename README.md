# Jwt-Authentication-API
JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication is a method of securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. It's commonly used in web applications to authenticate and authorize users. JWTs are digitally signed, compact, and self-contained, making them a popular choice for token-based authentication.
